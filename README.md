### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Glenn and I am an Android Developer currently looking for work. After 16 years working in Allied Healthcare I discovered my passion for software development and have since dedicated myself to a career change into this exciting industry.

After dipping my toe in the water with RMIT's Introduction to Programming, I completed a Diploma of Applied Information Technology at La Trobe University. Following this, I completed Android Developers' courses: <a href="https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course" target="blank">Android Basics with Compose</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course" target="blank">Android Basics in Kotlin</a>. You can check out my Google Developer profile <a href="https://developers.google.com/profile/u/glenn-halls" target="blank">here</a>.

## Current Project
Inspired by the knowledge gained thanks to <a href="https://developer.android.com/" target="blank">Android Developers</a>, I am currently working on an app to showcase these skills. <a href="https://github.com/Glenn-Halls/My-Bookshelf" target="blank">My Bookshelf</a> is an app that allows users to search for books via Google's database of over 40 million books, or to see what is currently popular via New York Times' Bestseller charts. Users can track books on the bestseller charts, save books to their library (including personal notes) and mark their favourites books for easy perusal.

This app demonstrates:

  <li>Repository Patten</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/manual" target="blank">Manual Dependency Injection</a></li>
  <li>Unit and Instrument Testing</li>
  <li>MVVM</li>
  <li>Kotlin Coroutines</li>
  <li>Room Database</li>
  <li>RESTful API queries</li>
  <li>Material Design</li>

</ul>
