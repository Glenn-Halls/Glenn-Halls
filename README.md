## Current Project
Inspired by the knowledge gained thanks to <a href="https://developer.android.com/" target="blank">Android Developers</a>, I am currently working on an app to further develop these skills. <a href="https://github.com/Glenn-Halls/My-Bookshelf" target="blank">My Bookshelf</a> is an app that allows users to search for books via Google's database of over 40 million books, or to see what is popular via the New York Times Bestseller charts. Users can track books on the charts, save books to their own database (including a personal rating and reading notes) and mark their favourites for easy perusal.

## Side Project: Wear OS
My side passion project was to create a watch face for Wear OS that is functional and displays all the information I desire, all while maintaining a classic style. I am happy with the result of this project and continue to use it every day. The next step in this project is to get it published on both Google Play and the Samsung Galaxy Store. You can download the watch face for personal use, or check out the code base <a href="https://github.com/Glenn-Halls/Vorlauf" target="blank">here</a>.

I hope that this repository can serve as a learning tool for other developers, as there are precious few open source examples of Watch Face Format, and none that I could find that implemented all of the components required for a premium watch face.
